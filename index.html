                    Hi, and thanks for visiting my blog post. I'm excited! This is my first actual post on anything regarding my web development path. This is also my first real design on anything. It seems pretty simple to the reader, I am sure. However, it's still my very first project! I'll be formatting more later on with my other projects to make sure they are properly done and look professional. In the meantime, I'm very grateful that you're reading these few short lines and hopefully I will be able to have you look at more of my portfolio and see what I've done and how I've progressed. I'll spice up this page more and have it looking more professional also.
                </p>

                    Well, here we are again and wow it's been quite a journey so far. I've been very busy and feel like i'm being rather productive, especially going the self-taught route. I've managed to build a pretty expansive game in javascript, I have started a portfolio page using codepen.io, a responsive gastronomia web page, and a few other little games and sites as well! It's been very engaging for me and soon I will study more vanilla javascript (no frameworks) to try and hone my skills a bit more. Perhaps I will check back in and be able to update further!
